# HPU-Team-Algorithm-Sorting-Speed-Project

This was a group project for our Algorithms class. Three other students and I worked together to test the speeds of various sorting algorithms, such as exchange sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort. We collaborated to test the different speeds of these algorithms and to see which one was the fastest and with which data. We also counted the number of comparisons each sorting algorithm made. We used different data sets such as an almost sorted array, a random sorted array, a reversed sorted array, and many duplicates array. 

Time was measured in milliseconds


Thanks to my classmates: Aidan, Ash, and Owen for working on this project.
